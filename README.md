# research-papers
We know there is so much material available due to the quick development of technology and multidisciplinary study, it can be challenging for people to locate academic resources and projects that fit their interests and skill set. Developing a web-based application that offers tailored suggestions for project ideas and scholarly research papers depending on the user's interests and skill set is the goal of this project in order to overcome this difficulty. After users enter their interests, abilities, and skill levels, the application will recommend customized project ideas for all skill levels, from novice to expert, along with descriptions and implementation advice. To help users access the most recent information in their subjects, it will also suggest pertinent scholarly papers and articles from reliable sources like IEEE, arXiv, and Springer. The project aims to provide the project ideas and research papers to the user at one place  when the user enters his skills which reduces the searching time to the user.
